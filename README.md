## 📖 CONCEPT

### ✨ VISION
> **Do more of what you love** while our AI system handles the administrative stuff!  
We connect AI with your business data to create your most powerful administrative employee.

---

### 🛠️ HOW IT WORKS
- **Interaction Tools**  
  - 💬 AI Chat – talk with your data as you would with a colleague  
  - 🟦 Entry Edit – edit entries directly using smart forms  
  - ✉️ Emailbot – let others ask your data questions via email  
  - 🌐 Shop – share datasets and accept orders  

- **Main System**  
  - 🧠 AI Brain – structures, visualizes, modifies and translates between humans and machines  
  - 🕸️ API Nexus – checks and prepares AI code for execution  
  - 🕳️ Stargate – connects TNX API with your server  

- **Your Server**  
  - 🧬 Your Data – databases and files remain on your own server  
  - 🔧 Other Tools – extend with any additional custom code  
  - 🕳️ Stargate – executes code on your server and returns responses

### 🌱 EVERYTHING BECOMES POSSIBLE
Unlike many rigid business software tools, TNX API lets you run everything on your **own dedicated server**.  
You can change, modify and adjust everything to your specific needs and add **every custom solution imaginable**.

---

### 🤝 WE ARE OPEN SOURCE
As you can see   XD, bringing basically the same advantages as above, but now even better.

---

### 🔧 ALL COMMON DATABASE ACTIONS
`INSERT INTO`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`, **SEARCH**, **GET CONTEXT**  
➡ getting your data ready for **AI**!

---

### 🛡️ SECURITY CONSTANTLY IN MIND
- data stays on your own dedicated server (even legacy servers supported)  
- automatic log files for every AI action  
- regular backups on your server possible  
- different access rights for admin and user accounts  

---

### 💡 EXAMPLES OF WHAT OUR SYSTEM CAN DO
- create charts and editable tables for data visualization  
- write PDFs *(invoices, offers, delivery receipts, reports, contracts, legal documents, …)*  
- handle uploads *(extract key information, classify and enter into database)*  
- code like an expert *(adjust entries or bulk update tables in seconds)*  

---

### 💬 OUR PROMISE
> *"We take care of your organizational business stuff, so you can concentrate on building great products and services for great people."*

## 🧪 TESTING SETUP
For local testing you must fill in the placeholders in `config.php` with your own credentials. Replace every `PLACEHOLDER_*` value with a real database server, name, user, password and API key before running the code.
